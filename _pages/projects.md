## Open-Source Projects

- Developing and maintaining [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), an open-source object detection framework with 11.6k stars on
 GitHub. 
  - Implementing detection models in MMDetection, e.g. YOLO v4; reproducing
 their performances and optimizing their speed, making them modular
  components for in-place usage of all 40 detection models; 


## System

- An Optimized CUDA Implementation of CNN Forward Pass  
  - Reimplemented the CNN forward algorithm of MXNet in CUDA using im2col + GEMM with bells and whistles, [Github](https://github.com/RyanXLi/CUDA_CNN)  
  - ranked top 10 out of over 60 groups  

- System Programming and Operating System  
  - Implemented `malloc`, parallel `make`, a simplified shell, a command line text editor, and a server-client model  
  - Code kept private as per course rules  

- Computer Graphics  
  - Implemented [Ray Tracer](https://github.com/RyanXLi/4411_RayTracer) in C++, [Modeler](https://github.com/RyanXLi/4411_Modeler) and [Animator](https://github.com/RyanXLi/COMP4411-Animator) with OpenGL, and an [Image processor](https://github.com/RyanXLi/4411_Impressionist) using convolutional filters  




## Design / Web

- HKUST & CAA Design Thinking Project: Blurred  
  - In a month-long joint project in collaboration with the China Academy of Art, Designed a household smoke detector with a strong visual hint of the damage on family members' health, [poster](http://designthinking.ust.hk/poster/2018/B.pdf)
  - Lead the team in ideation and electronics design  

- Web Programming  
  - [Roadmap](https://github.com/RyanXLi/Roadmap): an academic planning app for HKUST students  
  - [GradeBuddy](https://github.com/RyanXLi/GradeBuddy): a grade-tracking web app with React  
  - Involved in the design and implementation of both apps, as well as data crawling and presentation  



## Other AI / ML

- One-shot Pokemon Classification  
  - Classify pokimon images given only 1 reference per class. Adopted a metric-learning based baseline and make improvements  
  - Improved 5-way top-1 accuracy from 55.3% to 71.6%  

- TMDB Box Office Prediction  
  - Feature engineering and text embedding with a XGBoost based ensemble model  
  - Top 6% on Kaggle at the time of submission
